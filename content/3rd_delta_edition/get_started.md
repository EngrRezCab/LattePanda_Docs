## Steps for Booting Up Your LattePanda

### What You Will Need

To get started, you will need the following hardware:

* LattePanda 3 Delta Mainboard
* USB Type C Power Adapter(attached in the box), or Other 12V Power Adapter

### Instructions

!!! warning
    The LattePanda is relatively special in its pocket-sized product form and design, and it can connect with multiple devices to provide unlimited possibilities for embedded developments and IoT innovations. 
    

    However, the CPU-related products are all **electrostatically sensitive**, so, although we have adopted the **anti-static design**, users still need to be careful when using these electronics. 
    
    **Be sure to remove the static electricity from your body before touching the LattePanda!** Otherwise, this may cause potential static discharge and damage your LattePanda!

* Connect the Wi-Fi/BT antennas to the sockets.

There are two antennas sockets on the wireless module. One socket is used for 2.5G&5G Wi-Fi, and the other one is used for Bluetooth. So please insert two antennas. Both antennas are the same.



!!! Tip
