# Purpose of sample code

If you possess knowledge of programming, you are likely acquainted with the classic first test code, which is printing "Hello world!" onto the command line. This customary practice commenced with "The C Programming Language" where it was utilized as the initial demonstration program. Subsequently, fellow programmers sustained the tradition when studying programming or debugging novel device environments.

Similarly, within the embedded and hardware fields, a comparable "Hello world!" example exists -- illuminating a small LED for debugging. In the progression of single-chip microcomputers or embedded devices, illuminating an LED serves as a fundamental debugging technique.

This article will delineate how to manipulate the pinpong library on LattePanda 3 Delta to operate an LED light. With the support of pinpong library, you can facilely regulate a range of common open source hardware, accomplish seamless linkage between software and hardware, and significantly abbreviate the development process.

# Hardware connection

By viewing the product page of LED small lights:

We can see that the LED can be connected to a driving voltage of 3.3-5V and controlled by high and low levels. So we can connect it to the Arduino digital output pin on the onboard of LattePanda for control. The Arduino Leonardo onboard of LattePanda 3 delta supports 24 digital outputs, corresponding to pins D0~D23.

This tutorial takes D13 pin as an example and connects the LED small light to 5V voltage for driving:

# Programming

In this example, we use the IDLE text editor that comes with Python to edit code. If you are familiar with the editing and compiling process of Python code, you can also use your own preferred code editor

-  In Lesson 1, you have already installed the Python 3 environment, so IDLE will also be automatically installed on your LattePanda. Search for IDLE in the search box and open it.

- Enter the following Python code

   	import time
   	
   	from pinpong.board import Board,Pin
   	
   	#Board("uno").begin() #Initialization, select board type (uno, microbit, RPi,) and port number. If the port number is not entered, it will be automatically recognized
   	
   	Board("leonardo","COM5").begin() #Specify the port initialization under Windows
   	
   	#Board("uno","/dev/ttyACM0").begin() #Specify the port initialization under Linux
   	
   	#Board("uno","/dev/cu.usbmodem14101").begin() #Specify the port initialization under MacOS
   	
   	led = Pin(Pin.D13, Pin.OUT) #Pin initialization as level output
   	
   	while True:
   	
   		#led.value(1) #Output high level method 1
   	
   		led.write\_digital(1) #Output high level method 2
   	
   		print("1") #Terminal printing information.
   	
   		time.sleep(1) #Wait for 1 second and keep the state
   	
   		#led.value(0) #Output Low Level Method 1
   	
   		led.write\_digital(0) #Output Low Level Method 1
   	
   		print("0") #Terminal printing information.
   	
   		time.sleep(1) #Wait for 1 second and keep the state
