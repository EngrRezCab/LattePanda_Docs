!!! warning
    Please note that the LattePanda is a uniquely designed, pocket-sized device that offers endless possibilities for embedded developments and IoT innovations. As with all CPU-related products, the LattePanda is electrostatically sensitive. Although we have implemented an anti-static design, it is crucial to be cautious when handling the device. Please ensure that you remove any static electricity from your body before touching the LattePanda. Failure to do so may result in potential static discharge and damage to your device.   
    
!!! note
    After assembling the components, please attach the metal backplane to safeguard the LattePanda board's bottom components from short-circuit damage due to small metallic objects.


* **Connect an M.2 NVMe SSD  to the M.2 M key socket.** <br>
Before using the M.2 sockets, if a metal backplane has been installed, uninstall the metal backplane first.<br>
