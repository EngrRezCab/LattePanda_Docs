### Instructions

!!! warning
    The LattePanda is relatively special in its pocket-sized product form and design, and it can connect multiple devices to provide endless possibilities for embedded developments and IoT innovations. 
    

    CPU-related products are all **electrostatically sensitive**. So although we have adopted the **anti-static design**, users still need to be careful when using these electronics. 
    
    **Be sure to remove the static electricity from your body before touching the LattePanda!** Otherwise, this may cause potential static discharge and damage your LattePanda!

* Connect Wi-Fi/BT antennas to the sockets.
