# FAQ



**Q.** When LattePanda power on, it enters into the EFI shell,  not the windows or Linux OS. The OS is installed in the onboard eMMC chip.

**A.** Please update the BIOS firmware to the latest version.  Refer to ''Update the BIOS Firmware'' chapter in the [BIOS Setup](http://docs.lattepanda.com/content/3rd_delta_edition/bios/) section. The latest version is “LP-BS-7-S70JR120-CN51G-D”.
