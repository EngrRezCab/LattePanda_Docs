# Hardware Driver

## Regular Driver
If you do not use the windows image file provided by us, you may encounter driver problems. **You can use the windows update to get the latest drivers. Most drivers, like WiFi, ethernet, graphics, will be installed correctly.** 

If you still find some unknown devices in the device manager, please use the following method.

We packaged the hardware drivers from the normal windows operating system. So you could directly download the driver files. These drivers may not be the latest, but they all work fine in windows 10 and 11.

* How to install the driver of the unknown device?
  
  * [Download the driver files.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q0rdgtnlp4wlajw/AADj-vQKuu5ZM3OCEmXDHWJka?dl=0)
  
  * Unzip the driver files. You could unzip them in the same folder.
  
  * Open the device manager, then select the unknown device. 

    Right Click -> Update driver -> Browse my computer for drivers, then select the folder where you unzip the driver files.

## Touch Panel Driver

The touch panel driver for LattePanda 3 Delta is the same as that for the LattePanda V1.0 and LattePanda Alpha/Delta.
